# TCSC
Documentation of the article "A Mathematical Programming Approach for Allocation and Analysis of TCSC in Power Transmission Systems " for IEEE Latin America

This code can be used to perform maximum loadability analysis of the network using TCSC allocation and studies related to TCSC adjustments for different objectives.
To solve the problem, Knitro can be used as well as other solvers. Due to the non-linear and non-convex characteristic of the problem, the adjustment of the parameters 
of the solvers can lead to different solutions, as well as the adjustment of the limits of the variables and constraints.
